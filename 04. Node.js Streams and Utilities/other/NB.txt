When using Nginx as a web server, you can set up URL 
redirects by creating a new server block in your Nginx 
configuration file. This server block should listen on 
the original URL and then redirect the request to the 
new URL. For example, if you wanted to redirect all 
requests for http://www.example.com to http://www.new-example.com, 
you could use the following configuration:

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name www.example.com;

    return 301 http://www.new-example.com$request_uri;
}
