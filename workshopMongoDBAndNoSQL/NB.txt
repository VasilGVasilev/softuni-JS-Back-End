No need to use MongoDBCompass to set the new DB and collections
Creating a Mongoose Schema, connecting it and making a POST request will upload the whole DB structure ->
collections even documents if you used the POST request functionlaity to create cubes


 An async function returns a Promise.

 The value of the Promise depends on how the async function is written. 
 If the async function returns a value, the Promise will be resolved 
 with that value. If the async function throws an error, the Promise 
 will be rejected with that error.

 Here is an example of an async function that returns a value:

 async function getData() {
   return 'Hello, World!';
 }

 getData().then((value) => {
   console.log(value);  // "Hello, World!"
 });

 thus, when you extract DB via cubeService.getAll() and return cubes
 the returned cube is just a return of the async function cubeService.getAll()
 -> in homeController cubeService.getAll() requires await so that as promise it is resolved

 When having intermodular communication, have in mind that async functions return promises 
 which should be resolved even if the very async function executed awaits a promise within itself.

 Relations
    if it is an array, it is many to many, if it one object its obvious that only one relation is possible
    the 'type' has to be set to be OBJECT>ID
    the 'ref' has to be set to the relevant model
