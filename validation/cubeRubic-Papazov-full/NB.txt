req.user 

    authmiddleware
        req.user set in auth middleware is an additional custom property .user that we manually create
        in it we store the decoded token with 4 properties of its own

    cubeController create
        cube.owner property is added manually to cube object and populated with req.user._id

    cubeController details
        specific cube is referenced by cube.owner (holding the id of the owner) 
        and is used to judge if a cube owner's id is the same as the the current req.user?._id (? is to avoid error if no user property is attached to req)
        if it is a var isOwner is true and this reflects on the contents of details template

res.locals

    authMiddleware auth
        Use this property to set variables accessible in templates rendered with res.render. 
        The variables set on res.locals are available within a single request-response cycle,
        thus, can be user specific

        res.locals.user = decodedToken can then be used in every template

    views/details

        {{#if user}} comes from the hovering above all the app res.locals
