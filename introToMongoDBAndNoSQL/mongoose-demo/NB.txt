app.use(PATH, router) is for attaching mini-app/router to a specific path
routers are usefull for abstracting logic so that main app is not cluttered,

module.exports vs exports
exports. is for exporting functions and values individually
module.exports is (default export) for exporting the whole module

Mongoose is preferred because it provides SQL-like schema or model,
this model is setting what Mongoose should expect

Extract model from DB and attach to template
const movies = await Movie.find().lean() to get all movies and use them in a template res.render()

connect to specific DB
const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/movieSuggester';
connect to a specific DB is to add name of DB to url: url += /movieSuggester
