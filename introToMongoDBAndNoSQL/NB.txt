Horizontal scaling 

As mentioned above, sharding is horizontal scaling by spreading data across multiple nodes. 
Each node contains a subset of the overall data. This is especially effective for increasing 
throughput for use cases that involve significant amounts of write operations, as each operation 
only affects one of the nodes and the partition of data it is managing.

While sharding happens automatically in MongoDB Atlas, it is still up to us to configure 
the shard key, which is used by MongoDB for partitioning the data in a non-overlapping 
fashion across shards. This can be done automatically through either ranged or hashed sharding, 
or customized using zoned sharding.

Over time, datasets typically do not grow uniformly, and various shards will grow at faster rates 
than others. As your workloads evolve and data sets grow, there will be a need to rebalance data 
to ensure an even distribution of load across the cluster. This uneven distribution of data is 
addressed through shard balancing. 
In MongoDB, this is handled automatically by the sharded cluster balancer.
